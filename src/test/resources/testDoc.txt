Surviving relics to return to Kabul museum

KABUL, July 9 (AFP)  -
Valuable relics from Afghanistan's rich cultural past that have survived years of looting are to go back on display in the capital's battered museum, officials said Thursday.
Head of Kabul museum Qari Allefuddin Azizi said the purist Taliban militia would also restore the badly hit building following the receipt of international aid.
Azizi said 14,000 dollars had been donated by the United Nations cultural body UNESCO while the Dutch government had given 8,000 dollars for museum repairs.
He said the Taliban would also contribute to the cost of repairing the building, which became one of many frontline positions for rival factions following the fall of Kabul's communist regime in 1992.
Kabul museum housed around 100,000 items before it fell victim to armed looters.
The Society for Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage -- a group founded by Western scholars -- says many valuable items were smuggled out to Pakistan and sold on to collectors in the West and in Japan.
However thousands of items rescued from the plunder have been held in safe storage in the city.
The militia's deputy information minister, Mawlawi Abdurrahman Hotaki, dismissed as false propaganda allegations that the Taliban opposed pre-Islamic era monuments in Afghanistan. He said even the large collection of{ Afghan Buddhist-era relics would go back on show.
The purist Moslem militia, who seized power in Kabul nearly two years ago, have banned the "unIslamic" practice of displaying images of living creatures.
However Azizi said the display of items such as Buddhist statues would enable visitors to "take lessons.""
